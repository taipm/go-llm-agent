# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Run tests
make test

# Run examples
make run-simple
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork & Clone**: Fork the repository and clone your fork
2. **Branch**: Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. **Code**: Make your changes
4. **Test**: Add tests and ensure all tests pass (`make test`)
5. **Commit**: Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
6. **Push**: Push to your fork (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. **PR**: Open a Pull Request

## Code Guidelines

### Go Best Practices

- Follow [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)
- Use `gofmt` for formatting (run `make fmt`)
- Add comments for exported functions
- Write tests for new features

### Testing

- Maintain test coverage >= 70%
- Write unit tests in `*_test.go` files
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate

```go
func TestFeature(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   string
        want    string
    }{
        {"case1", "input1", "output1"},
        {"case2", "input2", "output2"},
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // test code
        })
    }
}
```

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: add streaming support for Ollama provider
fix: handle nil pointer in memory buffer
docs: update README with installation guide
test: add tests for tool registry
```
