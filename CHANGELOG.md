### Added

- **Self-Learning System (Phase 3)** - Intelligent experience-based learning

This release adds professional-grade logging to help users understand what their agents are doing, plus MongoDB database tools and critical memory fixes.

**Key Highlights:**

1. **See What Your Agent Is Doing** - New logging system with colored output and visual indicators makes it easy to track agent behavior in real-time
